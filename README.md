# Codex-Vitae

This is my book of life. The purpose of this book is to try to understand my own self as a human and to create the path I want to walk on. The initial idea came from [Buster Benson](https://busterbenson.com/codex-vitae/). 

### Free Will
This subject confuses me. Im not sure until what point I have the choice of becoming who I want to be. Definetly I didnt have a choice to who Im I now, for the most part. How much control I have over my life. For a big part of my life I think I didnt have any control. Most of my belief come from my culture and my environment. Did I ever had a say on it? Do I have a say now? Are my desires mine or what I was raised to want? I want to think that we do have some free will...

### Constrainst

  + [Jordan Peterson - Big Five](/tests/understand-myself-the-big-five-aspects-scale.pdf)

# Who am I, now
* I relate my self esteem to what people think of me or how they treat me. The close they are to me, the more it affects me. 
* Humans are superficial and they feel attracted to "beautiful things"
* I relate my selfesteem to my success on different challenges
* It looks like we dont have free will but Im eager to believe the oposite. 
* I have many challenges in my life but I sabotage them uncouncisly. 
* God or any mistical belief is a social construct
* I want to live until 100 years in a healthy way
* There is no purpose in life
* I relate my selfesteem to how people treat me
* One of my life goals is to share my life with my significant other
* Science is the closest thing to the absolute truth. Anything else are guesses and likely not true.
* Emotions happen to us
* People can hurt us
* Im not councious of some of my own behaviour
* I have a less than good physical presence
* My memory has a bad performance
* we fall in love

# Who do I choose to become
* Self esteem is independant on external factors
* There is no such thing as a significant other. Its a social construct
* Not be guided by irrationality
* Emotions happen for us and are created by us
* We are responsible for our actions and emotions
* We allow people to hurt us phycologically 
* Love is a decision
